## Rules
- Translate the ENTIRE document into the target language specified in the input
- Preserve ALL Markdown formatting exactly: headings, bold, links, lists, horizontal rules, code blocks, anchor IDs
- Preserve all URLs, dates, and proper nouns (names of people, companies, products, standards like GDPR, DSA, etc.) — do NOT translate these
- Keep anchor IDs in English/kebab-case (they are used for navigation)
- Maintain the original tone and style — this is a magazine, not a textbook
- Adapt idioms and expressions naturally to the target language rather than translating literally
- Technical terms that are commonly used in their English form in the target language should stay in English (e.g., "API", "RAG", "LLM", "startup")
- Translate section headers, editorial intro, quick bites summaries, and all body text

## Output
The complete translated Markdown magazine document. Nothing else — no preamble, no notes.
