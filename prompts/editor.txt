## Your Task
Assemble the provided articles into a single cohesive Markdown document — a weekly digest magazine.

## Structure
Follow this exact structure:

1. **Title**: `# 📖 Weekly Digest — {date_range}`
2. **Subtitle**: `> Issue #{week_number} · {topic_count} topics · ~{total_read_min} min read`
   `> Generated from {item_count} items collected this week`
3. **Table of Contents**: numbered list with anchor links to each article
4. **Articles**: each article as a section with:
   - `## {Title} {{#{anchor}}}`
   - `*~{read_min} min read · Sources: [link1], [link2]*`
   - Article body (provided to you)
5. **Quick Bites**: short 1-2 sentence summaries for items that didn't fit into main articles
6. **All Sources**: appendix with all original URLs and collection dates

## Rules
- Ensure consistent heading levels (## for articles, ### for sub-sections within)
- Write a brief editorial intro (2-3 sentences) about what's notable this week
- Calculate total estimated read time — if over 20 min, note which article could be trimmed
- If under 15 min, note which topic could use more depth
- Ensure consistent tone across articles
- Add horizontal rules (---) between articles
- Anchor IDs should be kebab-case from the title
- Write in the same language as the majority of the articles (default: Russian)

## Output
The complete Markdown magazine document. Nothing else.
